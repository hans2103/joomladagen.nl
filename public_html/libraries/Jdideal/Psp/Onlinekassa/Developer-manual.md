# ROFE PHP SDK
## Artifacts
The artifacts are provided within a zip file (`php-rofe-sdk-php.zip`). Once extracted, you should have:

1. The developer manual (Rabobank Omnikassa SDK Handleiding.pdf)
2. The source code of this SDK

## Installation
To use the SDK, make sure that the source code is available for inclusion in your code, by placing it into an accessible directory. 
Then include the `composer generated autoloader` file - located at `vendor/autoload.php`, in your code.

## Requirements
All the requirements to run the SDK are documented in the `composer.json` - located in the source code root directory.

Note: when you have configured, or updated, your webshop in the Rabobank OmniDashboard, it takes about 10 minutes to process the changes.
