/*
Organisms

#### Organisms are **groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together to form distinct section of an interface.**

#### Organisms can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.

#### Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, reusable components.
