/*
Atoms

#### In chemistry, atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. They have distinct properties and can't be broken down further without losing their meaning.
#### Translated to interfaces, **atoms are basic tags**, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.

#### Atoms are abstract and aren't often terribly useful on their own, but they provide a useful reference and allow you to see all your global styles laid out at a glance.
